This website contains a collection of questions that have been previously asked on the CoronaNet Slack channel. Please refer to our \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvNMpwj0onFvUZ_gLl4RRjqS-clbHv3TIX6EOHofsME/edit}{codebook} for more general information about policy categories and coding.

\chapter{Frequently Asked Questions}\label{frequently-asked-questions}}

We have compiled keywords for common types of questions we have received on the \#ra-chat channel. You can also use the search bar at the top of the page.

\hypertarget{flights-chartering-airports-airplanes-travel-visa-abroad-trip}{%
\section{Flights, chartering, airports, airplanes, travel, visa, abroad, trip}\label{flights-chartering-airports-airplanes-travel-visa-abroad-trip}}

\textbf{How to code that a government implements health screenings for passengers entering a country?}\\
Policy type: ``External Border Restrictions''\\
Sub-category in the follow up question (type\_ext\_restrict): ``Health screenings''\\
The distinction between health screenings at airports, and the ``Health Testing'' category not done at the border, is that the goal of the health screening at the border is to restrict entry, whereas the goal of `Health Testing' is to ascertain the underlying infection rate.

\textbf{How to code the cancellation of visa appointment (from all or a particular country)?}\\
Policy type: ``External Border Restriction''\\
Check ``visa'' in the ``travel mechanism'' question.

\textbf{How to code the cancellation of school trips both abroad and in the country?}\\
Please make two entries:\\
1. Policy type: ``External Border Restriction''\\
2. Policy type: ``Internal Border Restriction''

\textbf{How to code the government banning employment agencies from sending any workers abroad?}\\
Policy type: ``External Border Restrictions''\\
Target direction: ``Outbound''

\hypertarget{public-transport}{%
\section{Public transport}\label{public-transport}}

\textbf{How to code the restriction of public transport (people being discouraged to use it)?}\\

Policy type: ``Other''

\textbf{How to code a policy in which people are asked to wear masks outside?}\\

Sub-category: ``Wearing of face masks''

\hypertarget{technology-robots}{%

\hypertarget{prison-arrest-arrested}{%
\section{Prison, arrest, arrested}\label{prison-arrest-arrested}}

\textbf{At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, there were some government actions/policies that are unofficial, never announced but later verified by journalists, should we include these materials? Also, what about incidents when whistleblower doctors were arrested and the govt asked the public not to spread rumors?}\\

\hypertarget{fake-news-online-misinformation}{%
\section{Fake news, online misinformation}\label{fake-news-online-misinformation}}

\textbf{How to code a policy that involves taking legal action against those spreading false information about COVID?}\\

\textbf{Turkmenistan banned the mention of ``coronavirus'' which has entailed a number of different policies: removing direct mentions of it from public health resources, media has been ordered not to use it; the police can arrest or fine people who wear face masks or say the word, etc.}\\
Banning the use of face masks and would fall under ``Other'' {[}note, previous guidance said `Health Resources', apologies{]} and the enforcement would definitely be `police' and `national level government' but please make a note at the end of the survey about the ban.\\
The media's ban on using the word coronavirus would fall under ``Public Awareness Campaign'' and again enforcement would include `police' and `national level government' but please make a note at the end of the survey about the ban.
